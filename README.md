AI Job Market Insights Power BI Dashboard: A Comprehensive Analysis
This Power BI project aims to provide detailed insights into the AI job market, leveraging various key factors such as job titles, industries, company sizes, locations, and salary distributions. The dataset used in this project contains categorical and numerical data related to the AI job market, including job titles, industries, automation risk levels, required skills, salary information, remote work trends, and job growth projections. The ultimate goal is to present business professionals, analysts, and students with a comprehensive tool to make informed decisions based on market trends.

Overview of the Dataset
The dataset includes a mix of categorical and numerical columns:

Categorical Columns: Job Title, Industry, Company Size, Location, AI Adaptation Level, Automation Risk, Required Skills, Remote Friendly, Job Growth Projection
Numerical Column: Salary (in USD)
The richness of this dataset allows for multifaceted analyses that explore trends in AI-related jobs, salary variations across industries and job titles, the impact of AI adoption, remote work preferences, and job growth projections. This project integrates both business analytics and advanced visualization techniques to provide actionable insights.

Key Metrics and Visualizations
To ensure a high level of data analytics, several new calculated columns and statistics have been introduced into the Power BI model. Key calculated metrics include:

Average Salary per Job Title: This metric provides the average salary for different job titles across the dataset, helping professionals understand compensation trends in AI-related roles.
Salary Range by Industry: This statistic calculates the spread between the highest and lowest salaries within each industry, helping companies gauge salary competitiveness.
Job Growth Rate: By converting categorical job growth projections (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low") into numerical values, we can quantify and compare growth projections across different job categories.
Remote-Friendly Job Count: This metric counts the number of remote-friendly jobs, enabling a deeper understanding of trends in flexible work arrangements.
Salary Distribution Analysis: By calculating salary quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3), the model helps identify salary distribution patterns across various categories.
